# Arivo Receipt Search Front End

## Introduction

This is the front end solution to an interview task provided by [Arivo](https://arivo.co/).  The API built to be consumed by this page can be found [here](https://github.com/JulianSiow/ArivoReceiptSearchApi).

For simplicity, this is a single page application using jQuery for DOM manipulation and Bootstrap to simplify style the form.  

This webpage is built to hit an API hosted at http://localhost:3000.  To change the url that the api is hosted at, change the variable ```APIUrl``` in ```script.js```
